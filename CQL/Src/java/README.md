# Overview

This project builds Java lexers, parsers, listeners, and visitors using ANTLR4.  It also includes a simple Main class
that can read in a CQL file and prints out a text version of the parse tree.

# Building the Project

This project uses the [Gradle](http://www.gradle.org/) build system.  A gradle wrapper, which automatically downloads
and uses an instance of gradle, is provided for convenience.  To build the project, simply execute the following
command:

    ./gradlew build

This will generate the ANTLR4 artifacts to `src/generated`, build the example code, and execute the simple tests.
To clean up the artifacts:

    ./gradlew clean

# Generating IDE Projects

You can generate an IDE project for IntelliJ IDEa:

    ./gradlew idea

# Executing the Sample Code

You can execute the sample code using the `gradlew` command or a script generated by gradle.

To execute the sample code using `gradlew` (which operates on ChlamydiaScreening_CQM.cql by default):

    ./gradlew run

To execute the sample code using a script generated by gradle, first generate the script:

    ./gradlew installApp

Then execute the generated script with the path to the CQL file as an argument:

    ./build/install/cql/bin/cql ../../Examples/ChlamydiaScreening_CQM.cql
